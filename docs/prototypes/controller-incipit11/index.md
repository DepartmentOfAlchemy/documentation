# Incipit 11

![Incipit 11](./img/incipit-revB-CaseTop.jpg)

The Incipit 11 is a prop controller that has:
* 1 12V solid state output rated at 1.5 amps
* 1 12V optically isolated input


## What's in a name

The name "incipit" is Latin for "it begins". It also means the beginning text of a manuscript or early printed book. It was chosen to complement the other controller named Codex 43. Where "codex" means an ancient manuscript text in book form. The Incipit 11 is a smaller controller with 1 digital output and 1 optically isolated input. The Codex 43 is a larger controller with 4 digital outputs and 3 optically isolated inputs.

## Rev B

This revision of Incipit 11 is the first version to use the current case. While the hardware layout is expected to stay the same the PCB size needs to be a bit smaller to fit within the case. Here are the anticipated updates for Rev C:
* Refactor the PCB to be a bit smaller: 42.6mm front-to-back and 42.5mm left-to-right
* Relocate the push button due to the changes to the PCB dimensions.
* Relocate the I2C address jumpers to the back of the board. This will allow changing the I2C address by just removing the back of the case. The PCB wont need to be removed from the case.
